Trends in Concentration of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2 ppm). Data is sourced from US Government's [Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division][home]. Two main series are provided: the Mauna Loa series (which has the longest continuous series since 1958) and a Global Average series (a global average over marine surface sites).

## Data

From the [site][home]:

> Data are reported as a dry air mole fraction defined as the number of molecules of carbon dioxide divided by the number of all molecules in air, including CO2 itself, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as parts per million (ppm). Example: 0.000400 is expressed as 400 ppm.
